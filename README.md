# Password Generator

## Description 

The goal of this project was to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. The user interface is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Javascript File

We had some starter code in our Javascript file, and to it I added:
* An Event Listener to prompt user after clicking on generate button
* Four arrays defining the various Character Sets (Special characters, numbers, lowercase and uppercase) 
* A function that asks the user how many charcters and what character types they would like their password to contain
* Actions assigned to each of the character type variables
* A function that randomly selects password characters based on the required parameters
